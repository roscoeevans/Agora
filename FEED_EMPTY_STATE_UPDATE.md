# Feed Empty State Update

## Problem

The "For You" feed was showing an empty state that said:
- **Title**: "Welcome to For You"
- **Message**: "Your personalized feed will appear here. Follow some people to get started!"
- **Action**: "Find People to Follow"

This messaging was incorrect because Agora has a robust recommendation system. If the user is seeing this empty state, it means they've already seen **every available post**, not that they need to follow more people.

## Solution

Updated the empty state to encourage **content creation** instead of following:

### New Empty State Design

- **Icon**: `checkmark.circle` (instead of `sparkles`)
- **Title**: "You're All Caught Up"
- **Message**: "You've seen all the latest posts. Why not share something with the community?"
- **Action**: "Create a Post" â†’ Opens compose sheet

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated `AgoraEmptyStateView.emptyFeed()` 
**File**: `Packages/Kits/DesignSystem/Sources/DesignSystem/EmptyStates/AgoraEmptyStateView.swift`

- Changed the empty state messaging to be contextually appropriate
- Added an `action` parameter to pass the compose handler
- Updated copy to follow Apple's UI/UX guidelines (clear, direct, action-oriented)

#### 2. Added Compose Button to HomeView
**File**: `Packages/Features/Home/Sources/Home/HomeView.swift`

- Added a compose button (pencil icon) in the navigation bar leading position
- Added state management for showing/hiding the compose sheet
- Passes compose action down to `HomeForYouView`
- Added Compose as a dependency

#### 3. Updated HomeForYouView
**File**: `Packages/Features/HomeForYou/Sources/HomeForYou/HomeForYouView.swift`

- Added `onComposeAction` closure parameter
- Passes the compose action to the empty state view
- Maintains backward compatibility with default empty closure

#### 4. Updated Home Package Dependencies
**File**: `Packages/Features/Home/Package.swift`

- Added Compose package as a dependency

## Apple Design Compliance

The new design follows Apple's Human Interface Guidelines:

âœ… **Clear and Direct**: "You're All Caught Up" clearly communicates the state  
âœ… **Action-Oriented**: "Create a Post" is a clear call to action  
âœ… **Contextually Appropriate**: Matches the user's actual situation (caught up, not new)  
âœ… **Encouraging Tone**: Positive "Why not share something" instead of demanding  
âœ… **Native Patterns**: Uses standard sheet presentation and SF Symbols

## User Experience Flow

1. User scrolls through For You feed
2. User sees all available posts
3. Feed shows "You're All Caught Up" empty state
4. User taps "Create a Post" button
5. Compose sheet opens
6. User creates and publishes post
7. Post appears in feed

## Additional Benefits

- **Consistent Access**: Added a compose button to the navigation bar for easy access anytime
- **Better Messaging**: Empty state now celebrates user engagement ("caught up") rather than suggesting they haven't done enough (follow more people)
- **Content Encouragement**: Shifts focus from consumption to creation, which helps grow the platform

## Testing

âœ… Build succeeds without errors  
âœ… No linter errors  
âœ… Compose sheet opens correctly from both:
  - Navigation bar button
  - Empty state "Create a Post" button

## Before & After

### Before
```
ðŸŒŸ Welcome to For You

Your personalized feed will appear here.
Follow some people to get started!

### After

âœ“ You're All Caught Up
