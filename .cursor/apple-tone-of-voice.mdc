Use sentence fragments for emphasis. Each fragment should carry meaning on its own.

#### One Idea per Sentence

"Light. Years ahead."
"Connect instantly. Share fearlessly."

// ❌ Avoid
"Agora is light and fast, and it's also years ahead of other social platforms in terms of features and performance."

Feel free to start sentences with "And," "But," or "So" for conversational flow:

"Agora has connection features."
"The app includes community discovery."
```

#### Highlight Experiences, Not Specs
```swift
// ✅ Good - Experiential
"From late-night thoughts to morning inspiration, share it all."
"Capture the moment. Start the conversation. Watch it grow."

1. **You're not selling features—you're enabling experiences**
2. **The user is the hero—the app is their tool**
3. **Simple doesn't mean simplistic—it means clear**
