  - Fixed `openapi-config.yaml` format for v1.10.3
  - Successfully generated client code

## üöß Remaining Tasks

### High Priority

1. **Complete Sign in with Apple Implementation**
   - Wire up `SupabaseAuthService.signInWithApple()` with actual Apple Sign In flow
   - Integrate with Supabase Auth API endpoints (`/auth/swa/begin` and `/auth/swa/finish`)
   - Handle continuation in ASAuthorizationControllerDelegate methods
   - Extract and store tokens in SessionStore

2. **Apply Database Migration**
   - Run `002_add_display_handle.sql` on Staging Supabase
   - Verify migration succeeded
   - Test with SQL Editor

3. **Wire OpenAPI Client**
   - Import generated types in OpenAPIAgoraClient
   - Replace placeholder implementations with actual API calls
   - Use generated Client from OpenAPI runtime
   - Configure transport and middleware

### Medium Priority

4. **SessionStore Enhancement**
   - Add method to check profile completion status
   - Integrate with auth state checking

5. **Production Testing**
   - Test Sign in with Apple on physical device
   - Test handle validation with real API
   - Test profile creation end-to-end
   - Test error scenarios (network failure, handle taken, etc.)

### Low Priority

6. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Test with VoiceOver enabled
   - Test with large Dynamic Type sizes
   - Test with Reduce Motion enabled
   - Test with high contrast mode

7. **UI Polish**
   - Verify Liquid Glass effects on different devices
   - Test animations and transitions
   - Ensure smooth 60 FPS performance
   - Test on different iPhone sizes

## üìã Testing Checklist

- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Sign in with Apple flow works on physical device
- [ ] Handle validation works with real API
- [ ] Handle availability checking works (including debouncing)
- [ ] Handle suggestions appear when unavailable
- [ ] Display handle capitalization is preserved
- [ ] Profile creation succeeds

- [ ] Auth state persists across app launches
- [ ] Sign out works correctly
- [ ] Error handling shows appropriate messages
- [ ] VoiceOver navigation works

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Backend Setup**
   - Apply database migration to Staging
   - Implement API endpoints in backend
   - Test endpoints with Postman/curl

2. **Client Integration**
   - Wire OpenAPIAgoraClient to generated code
   - Complete SupabaseAuthService.signInWithApple()
   - Test integration end-to-end

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Test on physical device with Staging
   - Fix any discovered issues
   - Document setup process
   - Create user guide for testing

## üìù Notes

### Design Decisions

- **Dual Handle System**: Following Twitter's approach with canonical lowercase handle for uniqueness and display handle for user's preferred capitalization
- **Debouncing**: 300ms debounce on handle availability checks to balance UX and API load
- **Mock-First**: Full stub client implementation allows UI development without backend
- **State Machine**: Clear auth state transitions prevent invalid states
- **Apple Design**: Strict adherence to HIG for familiar, native-feeling UI

### Known Limitations

- Sign in with Apple requires physical device for testing
- Backend API endpoints not yet implemented
- OpenAPI client not yet wired to generated code
- Session persistence not fully implemented

### Performance Considerations

- Handle validation is instant (client-side regex)
- Handle availability is debounced (reduces API calls)
- Animations are lightweight (opacity, translation only)
- Lazy evaluation prevents unnecessary renders
