# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on scaffolding the initial iOS app structure for Agora, a human-only social platform. The scaffolding will establish the Swift Package Manager (SPM) based modular architecture with proper feature modules, shared kits, and placeholder implementations to ensure the app compiles and provides a solid foundation for development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly structured iOS project with SPM modules, so that I can develop features in isolation and maintain clean architecture boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is opened THEN the app SHALL compile successfully with all package dependencies resolved
2. WHEN examining the project structure THEN it SHALL contain separate Feature modules for each major app surface
3. WHEN examining the project structure THEN it SHALL contain shared Kit modules for cross-cutting concerns
4. IF a module is created THEN it SHALL have proper Package.swift configuration with appropriate dependencies
5. WHEN building the project THEN all modules SHALL compile without errors using placeholder implementations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Feature modules for each app surface, so that I can work on specific features without affecting other parts of the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining Features directory THEN it SHALL contain HomeForYou, HomeFollowing, Compose, PostDetail, Threading, Profile, Search, Notifications, and DMs modules
2. WHEN a Feature module exists THEN it SHALL have Sources and Tests directories with proper structure
3. WHEN a Feature module is created THEN it SHALL have placeholder SwiftUI views and ViewModels that compile
4. IF a Feature module has dependencies THEN they SHALL be properly declared in Package.swift
5. WHEN importing a Feature module THEN it SHALL expose only public interfaces needed by the main app

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared Kit modules for common functionality, so that I can reuse code across features and maintain consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining Kits directory THEN it SHALL contain DesignSystem, Networking, Persistence, Auth, Media, Analytics, Moderation, Verification, and Recommender modules
2. WHEN a Kit module exists THEN it SHALL have proper public interfaces defined
3. WHEN DesignSystem kit is created THEN it SHALL include placeholder components following iOS design guidelines
4. WHEN Networking kit is created THEN it SHALL include basic HTTP client structure
5. WHEN Auth kit is created THEN it SHALL include Sign in with Apple integration structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main app target properly configured, so that it can integrate all modules and serve as the entry point.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the main app target THEN it SHALL have dependencies on all Feature modules
2. WHEN the app launches THEN it SHALL display a basic tab bar with placeholder screens
3. WHEN examining app configuration THEN it SHALL have proper Info.plist settings for iOS 26+ deployment
4. IF the app uses external dependencies THEN they SHALL be properly integrated through SPM
5. WHEN building for device THEN the app SHALL have proper entitlements and signing configuration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want placeholder implementations that compile, so that I can incrementally build features without breaking the build.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any module is built THEN it SHALL compile without errors or warnings
2. WHEN a SwiftUI view is created THEN it SHALL have basic placeholder content
3. WHEN a ViewModel is created THEN it SHALL use @Observable and have basic structure
4. IF a protocol is defined THEN it SHALL have at least one concrete implementation
5. WHEN running the app THEN all screens SHALL be navigable with placeholder content

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper test structure in place, so that I can write tests as I implement features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any module THEN it SHALL have a Tests directory with basic test structure
2. WHEN a test target exists THEN it SHALL have proper dependencies on the module being tested
3. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL execute successfully with basic placeholder tests
4. IF shared test utilities are needed THEN they SHALL be available in TestSupport module
5. WHEN adding new tests THEN the structure SHALL support both unit and integration tests

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want minimal documentation for each module, so that future contributors or my future self can understand module roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining any module root THEN it SHALL include a README.md summarizing its purpose and dependencies
2. WHEN viewing public APIs THEN they SHALL have Swift documentation comments (`///`) describing their behavior
3. WHEN generating documentation via DocC THEN it SHALL succeed without warnings
4. IF a module has complex setup THEN it SHALL include usage examples in documentation
5. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN module documentation SHALL provide clear guidance

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. The project SHALL build using Xcode 16.0+ and Swift 6.2
2. The app SHALL target iOS 26.0 as the minimum deployment target
3. All code SHALL be structured as Swift Packages managed through Swift Package Manager (SPM)
4. The project SHALL compile and run successfully on iPhone 15 Pro simulator and physical device
