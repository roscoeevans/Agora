# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive environment strategy for the Agora iOS app to support development, staging, and production environments. The system will provide clean separation between environments while maintaining simplicity for solo development, with the ability to scale when adding team members. The implementation will build upon existing configuration infrastructure and avoid duplicating existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have separate environments (development, staging, production) so that I can safely develop and test features without affecting production data or services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL support three distinct environments: development, staging, and production
2. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL use completely isolated Supabase projects for each environment
3. WHEN building for different environments THEN the system SHALL use different bundle identifiers to allow side-by-side installation
4. WHEN building for different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific API endpoints and configuration
5. WHEN building for different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific Supabase URLs and API keys

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build-time environment selection so that there is no runtime confusion about which environment the app is targeting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the app THEN the environment SHALL be determined at build time through Xcode schemes and build configurations
2. WHEN using development scheme THEN the system SHALL compile with DEVELOPMENT flag and target development services
3. WHEN using staging scheme THEN the system SHALL compile with STAGING flag and target staging services  
4. WHEN using production scheme THEN the system SHALL compile with production flag and target production services
5. WHEN building a debug configuration THEN the system SHALL never target production services

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure secrets management so that API keys and sensitive configuration are properly isolated per environment and not committed to version control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing environment secrets THEN the system SHALL use separate plist files for each environment
2. WHEN committing code THEN secrets plist files SHALL be git-ignored to prevent accidental exposure
3. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL provide example plist files with fake values for reference
4. WHEN loading configuration THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages if required secrets are missing
5. WHEN accessing secrets THEN the system SHALL provide a type-safe configuration interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mock services for testing so that I can develop and test features without depending on external services or consuming API quotas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing features THEN the system SHALL provide mock implementations of external services (Twilio, hCaptcha, etc.)
2. WHEN running in development environment THEN the system SHALL allow toggling between mock and real services
3. WHEN running in development environment THEN the system SHALL provide a debug menu to toggle mock services
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use mock services by default
5. WHEN using mock services THEN they SHALL provide realistic responses for testing different scenarios
6. WHEN switching between mock and real services THEN the interface SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific app configuration so that each environment has appropriate settings for deep links, push notifications, and app metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific bundle identifiers
2. WHEN building for different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific app display names
3. WHEN handling deep links THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific associated domains
4. WHEN configuring push notifications THEN the system SHALL use appropriate APN environment settings
5. WHEN building for development/staging THEN the system SHALL display environment name in navigation bar or settings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple daily workflow so that I can efficiently switch between environments based on my development needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN doing daily development THEN the system SHALL default to development environment with mocks enabled
2. WHEN testing integration THEN the system SHALL allow easy switching to staging environment with real services
3. WHEN preparing releases THEN the system SHALL provide production environment configuration
4. WHEN switching environments THEN the process SHALL require only changing Xcode scheme
5. WHEN building different environments THEN the system SHALL prevent accidental production deployments from debug builds

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the environment system to integrate with existing architecture so that it doesn't duplicate functionality or break existing patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing environment configuration THEN the system SHALL extend existing xcconfig files rather than replace them
2. WHEN adding configuration loading THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing AppFoundation module
3. WHEN implementing service factories THEN the system SHALL work with existing protocol-based architecture
4. WHEN adding environment detection THEN the system SHALL use existing Swift compilation conditions pattern
5. WHEN storing secrets THEN the system SHALL build upon existing Secrets.plist structure
